# 🎣 Phishing Awareness Landing Page

This is a **mock phishing awareness landing page** designed for educational purposes during a cybersecurity minor project under Eddiglobe.

When a user clicks a fake phishing email link, they are redirected here and informed that they were part of a simulated phishing test — helping raise awareness on how phishing works and how to avoid falling for it.
